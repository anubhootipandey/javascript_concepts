The event loop, web APIs, and (micro)task queue work together to enable asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, a single-threaded language, by managing the execution of the call stack, web API callbacks, and promise-based tasks.

Key moments
The event loop in JavaScript coordinates the call stack, web APIs, task queue, and microtask queue to enable non-blocking asynchronous tasks, crucial in JavaScript's single-threaded nature.
Components like the call stack, web APIs, and task queue work together for asynchronous task handling in JavaScript's single-threaded environment.
Long-running tasks can freeze the program, but web APIs like geolocation can offload tasks to the browser, either through callback-based or promise-based asynchronous capabilities.
Web APIs use event loop to handle asynchronous tasks. Callbacks are pushed to task queue, then call stack, ensuring smooth execution without disrupting other tasks.
The event loop ensures the website remains responsive by handling callbacks asynchronously, preventing disruptions to the call stack.
SetTimeout function registers callbacks and delays, demonstrating how tasks are managed in the event loop, ensuring smooth execution without delays.
Promises utilize the microtask queue for callbacks, prioritized by the event loop, ensuring efficient execution of promise-based tasks.
When invoking fetch, it creates a promise object that is initially pending, triggers a network request, and handles promise reactions. Microtasks can create an infinite loop, but can be managed to prevent program freezing and improve code readability.
Explanation of how fetch works, from creating a promise object to handling promise reactions and network requests.
The concept of microtasks and how they can lead to an infinite loop, impacting program execution and ways to prevent freezing.
Utilizing promises to improve code readability and manage asynchronous operations effectively.
JavaScript is single-threaded, handling one task at a time. Web APIs interact with browser features, enabling async tasks in the background without blocking the call stack.
Web APIs allow interaction with browser features, initiating async tasks in the background without blocking the call stack.
Microtask Q is used by promise handlers for async function bodies after await, ensuring callback priority over task Q in the event loop.
