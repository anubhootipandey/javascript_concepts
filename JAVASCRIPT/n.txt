The event loop, web APIs, and (micro)task queue work together to enable asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, a single-threaded language, by managing the execution of the call stack, web API callbacks, and promise-based tasks.


Key moments:
00:00 The event loop in JavaScript coordinates the call stack, web APIs, task queue, and microtask queue to enable non-blocking asynchronous tasks, crucial in JavaScript's single-threaded nature.
          -Components like the call stack, web APIs, and task queue work together for asynchronous task handling in JavaScript's single-threaded environment.
          -Long-running tasks can freeze the program, but web APIs like geolocation can offload tasks to the browser, either through callback-based or promise-based asynchronous capabilities.
03:32 Web APIs use event loop to handle asynchronous tasks. Callbacks are pushed to task queue, then call stack, ensuring smooth execution without disrupting other tasks.
          -The event loop ensures the website remains responsive by handling callbacks asynchronously, preventing disruptions to the call stack. 
          -SetTimeout function registers callbacks and delays, demonstrating how tasks are managed in the event loop, ensuring smooth execution without delays.
          -Promises utilize the microtask queue for callbacks, prioritized by the event loop, ensuring efficient execution of promise-based tasks.
07:09 When invoking fetch, it creates a promise object that is initially pending, triggers a network request, and handles promise reactions. Microtasks can create an infinite loop, but can be managed to prevent program freezing and improve code readability.
          -Explanation of how fetch works, from creating a promise object to handling promise reactions and network requests.
          -The concept of microtasks and how they can lead to an infinite loop, impacting program execution and ways to prevent freezing.
          -Utilizing promises to improve code readability and manage asynchronous operations effectively.
10:40 JavaScript is single-threaded, handling one task at a time. Web APIs interact with browser features, enabling async tasks in the background without blocking the call stack.
          -Web APIs allow interaction with browser features, initiating async tasks in the background without blocking the call stack. 
          -Microtask Q is used by promise handlers for async function bodies after await, ensuring callback priority over task Q in the event loop.
