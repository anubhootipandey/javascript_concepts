1.What kind of scoping does JavaScript use?
--Lexical scope

2.What is the expected output?
var add = (function ( ) {
  var counter = 0;
  return function ( ) {
       counter += 1; 
       return counter;
}
})();    
console.log(add());
console.log(add());
console.log(add());
--Self Invoking Functions are used Explanation: The function that IIFE is returning contains the lexical context of the IIFE, and it's stored in ‘add’. It gets invoked 3 times, and each time the counter is updated in the same lexical context.
