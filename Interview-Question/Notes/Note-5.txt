1.What kind of scoping does JavaScript use?
--Lexical scope

2.What is the expected output?
var add = (function ( ) {
  var counter = 0;
  return function ( ) {
       counter += 1; 
       return counter;
}
})();    
console.log(add());
console.log(add());
console.log(add());
--Self Invoking Functions are used Explanation: The function that IIFE is returning contains the lexical context of the IIFE, and it's stored in ‘add’. It gets invoked 3 times, and each time the counter is updated in the same lexical context.


Q1. Explain Hoisting in javascript? (Uber)
Ans. Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript, where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.
Both functions and variables are hoisted in javascript.
hoistedVariable = 3;
console.log(hoistedVariable); // outputs 3 even when the variable is declared after it is initialized    
var hoistedVariable;

Q2. What is the role of a strict mode in JavaScript ? (Twitter)
Ans.The JavaScript strict mode is used to generates silent errors. It provides a "use strict"; expression to enable the strict mode. 
This expression can only be placed as the first statement in a script or a function. 
"use strict";    
x=10;    
console.log(x);
