1. How basic request is work ?
--Sure, here's a brief overview of how a basic request works:
Initiation: The client sends a request to the server.
Routing: The request is routed to the appropriate endpoint or resource on the server.
Processing: The server processes the request, which may involve querying a database, executing some business logic, or fetching data from other services.
Response: The server sends back a response to the client.
Handling: The client receives the response and handles it accordingly, whether it's displaying data to the user or performing further actions based on the response.
This process typically involves communication over a network, often using HTTP or a similar protocol, but the exact details can vary depending on the specific technologies being used.
