1. How basic request is work ?
--Sure, here's a brief overview of how a basic request works:
Initiation: The client sends a request to the server.
Routing: The request is routed to the appropriate endpoint or resource on the server.
Processing: The server processes the request, which may involve querying a database, executing some business logic, or fetching data from other services.
Response: The server sends back a response to the client.
Handling: The client receives the response and handles it accordingly, whether it's displaying data to the user or performing further actions based on the response.
This process typically involves communication over a network, often using HTTP or a similar protocol, but the exact details can vary depending on the specific technologies being used.

2. Do you know what is TCP && UDP ?
--TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data packets over a network, suitable for applications like web browsing and email.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is faster but less reliable than TCP, used for applications where speed is more critical than guaranteed delivery, like video streaming and online gaming.

3. Js Is singleThreaded and why is it so?
--JavaScript is single-threaded because it executes one task at a time in a sequential manner, which simplifies programming and ensures predictable behavior by preventing concurrent access to shared resources like variables and data structures.
