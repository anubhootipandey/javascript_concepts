//Find the last element of an Array
//(without using length property)

const arr = ['white', 'red', 'black', 'yellow'];


//My answer:-
console.log(arr.at(-1));

//The Array.at() method is used to retrieve an element from the array at the specified index. 
//The index can be positive or negative. If the index is negative, it counts from the end of the array.
