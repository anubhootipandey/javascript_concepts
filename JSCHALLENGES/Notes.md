-->The copyWithin method in JavaScript is used to shallow copy part of an array to another location within the same array, without modifying its length. The syntax for copyWithin is:


arr.copyWithin(target, start, end);

1.target is the index at which to copy the sequence to.
2.start is the index at which to start copying elements from.
3.end is the index at which to stop copying elements (this index is not included in the copied sequence).
