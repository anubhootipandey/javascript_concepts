1. Difference between pseudo elemnt and pseudo class?
My answer-
a--Pseudo-class: A pseudo-class is like a "state" of an element. It's used to style an element when it's in a certain state or condition, like :hover, :active, or :focus.
b--Pseudo-element: A pseudo-element, on the other hand,allows you to style specific parts of an element. It creates virtual elements that don't exist in the HTML, like ::before or ::after, which can be used to add content or style a specific part of an element.

2.Difference between margin and padding?
My answer:-
a--Margin: Margin is the space outside the border of an element. It creates space between the element and other elements around it.
b--Padding: Padding is the space inside the border of an element. It creates space between the element's content and its border.

3.Difference between box-sizing: border-box | content-box ?
My answer:-
a--content-box: This is the default box-sizing behavior. When you set an element to box-sizing: content-box;, the width and height you assign to the element only apply to the content of the element. Padding and border are added to the width and height.
b--border-box: When you set an element to box-sizing: border-box;, the width and height you assign to the element include the padding and border of the element. This means that the padding and border are included inside the element's specified width and height, so the overall size of the box is the width and height you set.

4.What is inheritance in CSS?
My answer:- Inheritance in CSS refers to the mechanism by which certain properties of an HTML element are passed down to its children. Here's a simplified explanation:

When you apply a style to an element, such as a color or font size, that style can be inherited by its child elements unless explicitly overridden. This allows you to set styles at a higher level in the HTML hierarchy and have them apply to all nested elements unless a child element has its own style for that property.

Not all properties are inherited by default. Properties like color, font-family, font-size, line-height, text-align, etc., are inherited, while properties like margin, padding, border, etc., are not.

To control inheritance, you can use the inherit value explicitly or initial to revert to the default value for that property.
