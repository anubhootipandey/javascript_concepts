1.What is http?
My answer:- HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of data comminication on the web.
When you type a web address (like www.google.com) into your browser, HTTP is the protocol used to transfer the web page
from the server to your browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.Difference between http and https?
My answer:- 
HTTP- data sent using http is not encrypted that means anyone on the network can potentially see what you are doing.
    -It typically uses port 80.
HTTPs-Data sent using https is encrypted using SSL/TLS that means making it much harder for anyone to see or tamper 
    with the data. 
    -Typically uses port 443.
    -Websites using https are generally trusted more beacuse they ensure secure connections.

3.Whenever some websites load let's say if we go to google.com in which all these things load HTML and CSS and JavaScript do they load immediately or one by one how do they load?
My answer:-
Step 1. DNS Lookup- Your browser translates the website URL into an IP address to locate the server hosting the site.
Step 2. HTTP/HTTPs Request- The browser sends a request to the server to fetch the web page.
Step 3. Server Response-The server responds by sending the HTML file, which is the main structure of the webpage.
Step 4. HTML Loading- The browser starts reading the html from top to bottom. As it reads, it builds the structure of the page(called the DOM).
        If the HTML includes links to CSS or JS files, the browser makes separate HTTP requests to fetch these files.
Step 5. CSS Loading- The browser downloads these CSS files and applies the styles to the HTML, determing how everything looks.
        This process is crucial because the browser often won't render the page until the CSS is loaded and applied.
Step 6. Javscript Loading- JS files can be linked in the <head>, at the end of the <body>, or inline within the HTML.
        If the browser encounters a <script> tag without attributes, it will stop rendering, fetch the script, and execute it immediately. 
        This can block the page rendering process.
        To avoid blocking, you can use the 'async' and 'defer' attribhutes:
           'async'- The script is fetched and executed asynchronously as soon as its available, without blocking HTML parsing.
           'defer'- The script is fetched in parallel but executed only after the HTML parsing is complete.
Step &. Rendering-Once the HTML is parsed, CSS is loaded and applied, and JavaScript is executed (if not deferred), the browser can render the content on the screen.
        Images and other media resources may continue to load in the background. 
The goal is to make the critical content load as fast as possible, which is why CSS is prioritized over JavaScript for initial rendering, and JavaScript is often loaded in ways that minimize blocking the rendering process.

4.Difference between element and tag in html?
My answer:-
Tag- Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They are used to mark the beginning and end of an HTML element.
Element-An element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It's the complete structure used to define content and attributes in HTML.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.What are the semantic tag in html?
My answer:- Semantic tags in HTML are tags that provide meaning about the content they enclose, both to the browser and to developers. These tags make the structure of the HTML document more readable and meaningful. 
            They help improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of web pages by clearly defining the different parts of a web page.
            Common semantic tags:- <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <figure>, <figcaption> and <mark>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.Benefits of using sematic tags?
My answer-
a.It is more readable and maintainable for the developers.
b.It provides SEO, means search engines can more accurately index the content of the webpage.
c.It improves accessibility means readers and assitive technologies can better understand and navigate the structure of a webpage.
d. It helps apply consistent styling across different sections of a webpage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.Difference between div and span tag?
My answer- div and span are non-sematic elements in HTML.
div-  is a block-level element used to group larger chunks of content. It often acts as a container for other HTML elements to apply styles or scripts to multiple elements at once.
      Block-level, meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
      Commonly used for layout purposes, such as creating sections, columns, and overall structure of a webpage.
span-  is an inline element used to group small portions of text or other inline elements. It is often used to apply styles or scripts to a specific part of the text within a larger block of content.
       Inline, meaning it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
       Commonly used for styling a part of a text within a paragraph or other inline elements, such as changing the color of a word or adding a tooltip to a specific piece of text.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.When to use div and span?
My answer:-
div- When you need to create a container for other elements and want to apply styles, scripts, or layout properties to a group of elements. 
     Ideal for sections, headers, footers, articles, and other structural divisions.
span- When you need to apply styles or scripts to a small part of the content, such as highlighting a word, adding a tooltip, or styling a specific piece of text within a larger block element.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.What is specificity in CSS?
My answer:-Specificity in CSS is a set of rules that determines which styles are applied to an element when there are multiple conflicting styles. 
           It helps the browser decide which CSS rules take precedence and should be applied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.Which has highest or lowest specificity in CSS?
My answer:- Styles written directly in the HTML element (e.g., <div style="color: red;">) have the highest specificity.
Element selectors (e.g., p, div) have the lowest specificity.
Class selectors (e.g., .class-name) have higher specificity than element selectors.
ID selectors (e.g., #id-name) have higher specificity than class selectors.

******NOTE******-----> Using !important overrides any other specificity rules, but it's generally best to avoid using it as it can make your CSS harder to manage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.How to calculate specificity?
My answer:- Specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used:
a-Inline styles: 1000 points
b-ID selectors: 100 points each
c-Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10 points each
d-Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1 point each

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12.What is box model?
My answer:- The box model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements on a web page are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. It essentially defines the space that an element occupies on the page, including its content, padding, border, and margin.
+----------------------------+
|         Margin             |
|  +----------------------+  |
|  |       Border         |  |
|  |  +----------------+  |  |
|  |  |    Padding     |  |  |
|  |  |  +----------+  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  Content |  |  |  |
|  |  |  +----------+  |  |  |
|  |  +----------------+  |  |
|  +----------------------+  |
+----------------------------+

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.Default value of box-sizing?
My answer:-By default, browsers use the content-box value for the box-sizing property. 
           This means that the width and height you set for an element only apply to the content area. 
           Padding and border are added outside of this width and height.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.Difference between position: absolute | relative?
My answer:-
Relative: Element remains in normal flow but can be moved using top, right, bottom, left.
Absolute: It takes an element out of the normal flow and positions it based on its nearest positioned ancestor or the whole page if none exist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.Default value of position property?
My answer:-The default value of the position property in CSS is static.
