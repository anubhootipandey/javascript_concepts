1.Why do we use alt attribute in images?
My answer- In simpler words, we use the alt attribute in images to provide a text description of what the image is about. 
This is important for a few reasons:

a-Accessibility: Screen readers used by visually impaired users can read aloud the alt text to describe the image, 
helping them understand its content.
b-SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines use alt text to understand and index images, which can improve the 
visibility of your website in search results.
c-Fallback: If the image fails to load, the alt text will be displayed instead, giving users context about the missing image.

2.What is DOCTYPE in HTML?
My answer:- It tells web browsers which version of HTML the page is written in. This helps the browser to correctly render the page.
Importance of <!DOCTYPE>:

a-Defines the Document Type: It specifies the version of HTML or XHTML used in the document.

b-Helps with Browser Compatibility: Different versions of HTML have different rules and standards. 
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration ensures that the browser interprets the page correctly.

c-Quirks Mode vs Standards Mode: Without a <!DOCTYPE> declaration, browsers may enter "quirks mode," 
where they try to interpret the page as if it were written for older versions of HTML. 
This can lead to inconsistent rendering.

3.What is the purpose of <head> tag in HTML?
My answer:-The <head> tag in HTML is used to provide metadata and other information about the HTML document. 
It contains elements that specify information about the document, such as its title, character set, styles, scripts, 
and other meta information.

4.What is pseudo class?
My answer:-A pseudo-class in CSS is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the selected elements. 
It allows you to style elements based on user interaction or their current state.
Examples: ':hover, :focus, :active, :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child(), :nth-of-type(), :nth-last-of-type() and :checked'

5.What is the purpose of pseudo classes?
My answer:-
Purpose of Pseudo-classes:

a--Enhancing User Experience: Pseudo-classes allow you to create interactive and responsive designs, 
improving the user experience by providing visual feedback based on user actions.
b--Styling Based on State: They enable styling elements based on their state or position in the document 
structure without needing to modify the HTML or use JavaScript.

6.What are cascade rules?
My answer:- The cascade in CSS determines which styles are applied to elements based on their specificity, order of appearance in the stylesheet, 
and the use of the !important keyword. It ensures that styles are applied predictably and allows for effective management of styles across 
a web page or application.

Cascade Rule in CSS:
a--Specificity: CSS rules with a higher specificity are applied over rules with lower specificity. Specificity is determined by:
                Inline styles (style attribute on an element) have the highest specificity.
                ID selectors (#example) have higher specificity than class selectors (.example) and tag selectors.
                Class selectors have higher specificity than tag selectors.
b--Order of Appearance: If two rules have the same specificity, the rule that appears last in the stylesheet (or is defined last in the code) is applied.
c--Important Rule: Styles marked with !important have the highest precedence and override all other styles, regardless of specificity or order.

7.Why do we use media queries?
My answer:-we use media queries in CSS to make our websites look good on different devices and screen sizes. Hereâ€™s why:
a---Responsive Design: Media queries allow us to apply different styles to a web page based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, 
like its width, height, or orientation (landscape or portrait).
b---Adaptability: They help us create designs that adapt and look good on various devices, from large desktop monitors to tablets and smartphones.
c---Tailored Experiences: With media queries, we can change the layout, font sizes, images, and other design elements to provide the best user 
experience for each device.
